A README file is a crucial document that provides information about a software project, its installation, usage, and contribution guidelines. The name "README" is a standard convention used to denote that the file should be opened and read by anyone who comes across it. Here's how to write a README file with standard syntax and structure:
1. File Format

Markdown is widely used for README files due to its simplicity and broad support. Other options include plain text, reStructuredText, or HTML.
2. Structure
Title

    Start with a project title at the top of the file, usually centered and bold.

    Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (````) for code blocks and specify the language (e.g., ```python) for syntax highlighting.
    Bullet Points: Use - or * for bullet points.
    Links: Use link text.
    Avoid Images: Unless necessary, since they can become outdated or inaccessible.
